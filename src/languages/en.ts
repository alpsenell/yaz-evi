      description: "Peace in a restored historic building.",
      history: "Bozcaada, historically known as Tenedos, is a captivating island in the northern Aegean Sea, rich with cultural and historical significance. Mentioned in Homer’s *Iliad*, the island played a strategic role during the Trojan War, serving as the hiding place for the Greek fleet before their legendary attack on Troy. Throughout its history, Bozcaada was home to various civilizations, including the Phoenicians, Aeolians, and Greeks, thriving as an important maritime hub during the Classical and Hellenistic periods.\n\nUnder Roman and Byzantine rule, it continued to be a vital outpost due to its strategic location near the Dardanelles Strait. In the 15th century, the island became part of the Ottoman Empire, where significant structures such as the iconic Bozcaada Castle were constructed. After the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it became part of modern-day Turkey.\n\nToday, Bozcaada is celebrated for its historic stone houses, picturesque vineyards, windmills, and pristine beaches, offering a harmonious blend of history, nature, and Mediterranean charm.",
